<h1 style="text-align:center">Before Rocket League</h1>
                                       <P style="text-align:center">When Rocket League was not around the game studio,'Psyonix', already made a game called SARP Battle-cars. The game was released in 2008 and releasing on the Playstation 3 with only having a couple of players that liked the game during its' life span with little players the game lasted for a few years and the game studio had to shut the game.</p>                                     
<h1 style='text-align:center'>The release of Rocket League</h1>                                            <p style="text-align:center"> After the dissapointment release of SARP Battle Cars Psyonix, the creators of SARP, decided to take concept of SARP then try to improve it and it worked, because of the improved hardware they can work on to make the game look good while increasing the game frame rate. In 2014, Psyonix released the first Rocket League trailer then a year later Rocket League is fully released. When Rocket League was released people thought it would just be the same failure as SARP, but the people thought wrong, because of the muiltiplayer and competitions the game was able to have support over 30 million people worldwide more then the population of Australia. </p>
